Breakthrough: run steps from HDF5-FEMNIST repo manually

- Complete download **(which one?)**, then unzip and place in “data” directory

- Run “group_by_writer”, where each writer has folder in “write_all” folder

- Run “converter” to create eponymous HDF5 file from “write_all” folder structure

- Author-intended “femnist_test” file loads HDF5 dataset, checks properties / data etc
